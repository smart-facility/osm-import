# osm-import
Code for importing openstreetmap data.

# Dependency installation using homebrew under OS X:
```shell
bash osx_install_dependencies.sh
```

# Dependency installation for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
```shell
bash linux_install_dependencies.sh
```

# Choosing subregions
See http://download.geofabrik.de for the list of links for subregions (or click on the subregion name for individual country download links).
Make sure you get the .osm.bz2 format file. I include the ones I use here in [osm_import.sh](osm_import.sh) by way of example.
