# Dependency installation using homebrew under OS X:
# brew install postgres postgis osm2pgsql wget
# wget -O - http://m.m.i24.cc/osmconvert.c | cc -x c - -lz -O3 -o osmconvert && mv osmconvert /usr/local/bin
# git clone https://github.com/mapserver/basemaps ../basemaps

# Dependency installation for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
# sudo apt-get install osm2pgsql postgresql postgis postgresql-9.3-postgis-scripts git wget
# wget -O - http://m.m.i24.cc/osmconvert.c | cc -x c - -lz -O3 -o osmconvert && sudo mv osmconvert /usr/local/bin
# git clone https://github.com/mapserver/basemaps ../basemaps

# See http://download.geofabrik.de for a list of links for subregions (or click on the subregion name for individual country download links).
# Make sure you get the (smaller) .osm.pbf format file.
# I include the ones I use here for example.

rm osm.sql.bz2 # remove the old compressed version. We do some steps later to transfer the db to a new host.

# You may need to tweak the cache size with the -C option (in MB), the default being too small to process the Asia .pbf file, for example.

# Clean up the .pbf files so that the latest versions are downloaded next time.
# I turn this off and comment out the wget lines when I want to debug the rest to save on downloads and time.
rm *.osm
# Database is no longer needed (we transfer it across to a different box) - you may want to comment this out.
